Hello! My name is Catinca, and I am the design coordinator for MINUS. I am passionate about creating visual and functional solutions that support the project’s goals and promote sustainability. My role is to ensure the project’s aesthetic represents our ideas perfectly. For me, this project is both an opportunity to explore and innovate in design and a chance to contribute to positive, lasting changes for the environment.
