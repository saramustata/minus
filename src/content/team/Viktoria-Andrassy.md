Hello! My name is Viktoria, and I am the expertise coordinator within MINUS. I am interested in scientific analysis and identifying practical solutions to reduce negative environmental impact. My role involves interpreting collected data and developing ideas together with my colleagues. For me, this project is both an opportunity to learn and a way to create positive, long-term change.
